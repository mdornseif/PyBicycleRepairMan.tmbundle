The biketextmate.py script was written by [David Coffin][1]. Paul Bissex
[updated, extended and explained it][2]. The current state somewhat in flux.
There is a Subversion Repository at
svn://open.e-scribe.com/python/misc/biketextmate (zurrently defunct) and a
darcs repository at http://e-scribe.com/software/python/biketextmate/

Maximillian Dornseif created a git repository out of the [code made available
by Paul Bissex][3] to collect further fixes.
